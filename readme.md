As you said 
Fun Fact - Although pretty simple, 99% of applicants have failed to make it Perfectly.

Also My Code is not so perfect but fulfilled all requirements.           :joy:


For Run This Contact form 

1. Create DB with any name.
2. import sql file.

5. use url localhost/PHP MAil/index.php to access contact form
6. Send message through the contact form.

There Are Many ways to send mail. I used Different mail sending method in my student life also professional.
1. PHP Mailer.
2. mail function.
3. Swift Mailer.
4. Google Mail Api's.



As You Said  "Do not attempt to cheat or use code generation, as it lacks logic and is cheap; you will be disqualified and reported."

I not Used any Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT).
But, i use google for how to get ip address of user .
and some syntax and php mail variable.

I Use many times GPT for generate code but i read it carefully.  as it lacks logic but, another hand we code very fast.

hope My Code Is Correct according to requirement.

I fullfilled only requirement. but This code is not secure till use api or jwt tokens. also i use only tls port not ssl it may cause some time mail goes in spam.

Not Used More CSS. Done at Last moment.
